Important stuff:

    You'll need Qt and qmake and all that jazz.
    DON'T edit the makefile.
    Run "qmake-qt4 monitor.pro" to build the makefile if you need to.
    
    Once ready, run
        ./monitor [--port N] [--file configfilename]
    to run it.
    
    The default is --port 13231 --file config.
    The current "config" is for the rover.
    
    "exampleconfig" contains lots of comments, and runs in association with a
    test file found in the directory "test" which produces packets of the form
    
        time=1363456055 lat=52.841473 long=-3.459698 a=0.099833 b=-0.666276

    You don't need to send every variable in every packet, but there must always
    be "time" which must be a UNIX timestamp.
