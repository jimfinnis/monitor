DONE    map labels
DONE    lines between map points
DONE    v shaped compass vectors (arrow system with customisable arrows)
        flash last location object on message update
WONTFIX (graph scales)
DONE    fix bug with similar named labels, batt_pwr is being mistaken for batt
        bitfield system
DONE    key events being eaten by map
DONE    "special" event buttons, such as "quit"
DONE    zoom/centre

DONE    proper state machine for switches and buttons (+docs)
            - can't click except when in OK or BADACK
            - click in BADACK doesn't send; it sets value to what was read (i.e. clears the error)
WONTFIX reverse long/lat ordering in map! (no, the lat/long is the Right Way)
DONE    click to send waypoint (wp_lat, wp_long) 
        
DONE    sliders should handle value recvd in OK

DONE    multiway switches and variable switch colours
        
DONE    wplat/wplon updated occasionally, line from lat/lon to wp
        disappears.
        
DONE    define colours in status block

DONE    rewrite slider as a state machine - it's getting ugly in there
        The behaviour has changed quite a bit to allow the slider to track
        the feedback value in a sensible way.

DONE    sliders taking over arrow key events

DONE    ability to set absolute size of buttons + buttonlike switches

DONE    line numbers on errors

DONE    ensure can receive broadcast UDP
        
DONE    make sure send on packet we receive data from (i.e. record that IP)

docs:
DONE    momentary 'set' doc
DONE    clarify feedback var doc (not obvious you need to specify 'var')
DONE    document removal of UDP send timestamp

DONE    new switch stuff ('set' and colours)
DONE    document integer sliders
 
DONE    audio warnings
